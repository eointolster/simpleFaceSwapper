Here's a complete step-by-step guide to set up the face swap project:
# Face Swap Project Setup Guide

## 1. Create and Setup Python Environment

### Using conda (recommended)
```bash
# Create a new conda environment with Python 3.9
conda create -n faceswap python=3.9
conda activate faceswap
Using venv (alternative)
# Create a new virtual environment
python -m venv faceswap-env
# On Windows
.\faceswap-env\Scripts\activate
# On Linux/Mac
source faceswap-env/bin/activate
2. Create Project Structure
faceswap/
├── models/
│   ├── inswapper_128.onnx
│   └── hughJackman.jpg
├── main.py
└── requirements.txt
3. Create requirements.txt
Create a file named requirements.txt with the following content:
onnxruntime-gpu
opencv-python
insightface==0.7.3
numpy
4. Install Requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Download Required Models
Download inswapper_128.onnx

Download inswapper_128.onnx from one of these sources:

Google Drive Link
Hugging Face


Place the downloaded inswapper_128.onnx file in the models folder

6. Prepare Source Image

Get a clear frontal face image (e.g., hughJackman.jpg)
Place it in the models folder
Update the source_image_path in the code to match your image name:

source_image_path = "./models/hughJackman.jpg"
7. GPU Setup (Optional but Recommended)
For NVIDIA GPUs:

Install NVIDIA drivers for your GPU
Install CUDA Toolkit 11.x from NVIDIA website
Install cuDNN for your CUDA version from NVIDIA website

For AMD GPUs on Windows:

Install DirectML runtime (usually comes with Windows updates)

8. Test the Setup

Run the script:

python notMouthFallbackCPUFaceSwap.py

You should see your webcam feed with face swapping applied when a face is detected
Press 'q' to quit the application

Troubleshooting
Common Issues:

No GPU Detected

Check if CUDA is installed correctly (for NVIDIA)
The program will fall back to CPU if no GPU is detected


Webcam Not Found

Try changing the camera_index in the code (try 0, 1, or 2)
Check if your webcam is properly connected


Import Errors

Make sure all requirements are installed correctly
Try reinstalling the requirements:

pip uninstall -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt

Performance Issues

Lower the capture_width and capture_height values
Ensure you're running on GPU if available
Close other GPU-intensive applications



Verifying GPU Usage
# Add this code at the start of main() to verify GPU usage
import onnxruntime as ort
print("Available Providers:", ort.get_available_providers())
System Requirements

Python 3.9 or higher
Webcam
For GPU acceleration:

NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support, or
AMD GPU with DirectML support (Windows)


At least 4GB RAM (8GB recommended)
2GB free disk space

Additional Notes

The face swap works best with clear, well-lit faces
Performance will be significantly better with GPU acceleration
Keep the source image resolution reasonable (e.g., 512x512 or smaller)
Make sure the source image has a clear, single face
